## When to Use
- Use when this upstream workflow matches the user's stated goal.
- Use when the task requires the procedures documented in this skill.

# Architecture Review

Use this skill when the user asks for architecture review using Ontoly evidence.

## Required Workflow

Follow [the shared Ontoly workflow. Also read [graph evidence rules, [MCP usage, [best practices, and [fallback rules when the task requires detail.

## Ontoly Capabilities

Use these capabilities first: `ExplainArchitecture`, `GraphStatistics`, `FindCycles`, `FindDependencies`, `EvidencePack`.

## Output Contract

Return:

- answer or plan
- capabilities invoked
- graph evidence with node ids, edge types, source spans, and graph hash when available
- confidence: high, medium, or low
- fallback reason if repository files were inspected

## Boundaries

Do not implement compiler, query, MCP, SDK, or business logic in the skill. Do not search repository files until Ontoly cannot answer or evidence must be confirmed.
