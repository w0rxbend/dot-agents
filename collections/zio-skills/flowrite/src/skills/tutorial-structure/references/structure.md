# Tutorial Structure

Design the section structure before writing a word. A tutorial is learning-oriented: it teaches concepts and builds mental models for a newcomer, following one linear path.

## Structural Template

```
1. Introduction
   - Who this is for (newcomer, no prior knowledge)
   - Learning objectives (3-5 bullets)
   - Brief outline of the sections
   - "We recommend reading from top to bottom"
2. Background / The Big Picture (optional, 1-2 paragraphs, NO code)
   - What problem the API was designed to solve; the mental model
3. Concept sections (3-6, one new idea each)
   - 1-3 sentences explaining the concept
   - Minimal annotated code block
   - Output/result showing it worked
   - No branching, no "alternatively"
4. Putting It Together
   - The complete runnable example combining all concepts
5. Running the Examples
   - git clone, then one `cd` straight into the examples module dir in a single
     path (e.g. `cd <repo>/<library>-examples`, not a separate `cd <repo>` and
     `cd <library>-examples`)
   - Per concept, in order: a collapsible `<details><summary>` embedding that
     example's source via `mdoc:embed:<path>:show-line-numbers` (same pattern
     as Putting It Together); a short sentence on how to run it; its
     `sbt "<id>/runMain ..."` command
6. What You've Learned
   - Objectives restated as achievements
7. Where to Go Next
   - Links to how-to guides and reference pages THAT EXIST — check before linking, and write prose
     without a link when none does. Never a placeholder to be resolved later.
```

## Section Design Rules

- **Linear progression**: No branching. Never "if you need X, do Y instead". Pick one path.
- **One concept per section**: Each section introduces exactly one new idea or builds incrementally.
- **Concept before code**: Explain what the code does and why before showing it.
- **Every section has code**: No pure-prose sections.
- **Line-by-line annotation**: Follow every code block with a bullet breakdown of each line or block of lines.
- **Show intermediate output**: After meaningful steps, show results so the learner can verify.
- **Limit scope aggressively**: A tutorial on "understanding Scope" is not "everything you can do with Scope". Stay on the objective.
- **Numbered headings**: Use "## 1. Topic", "## 2. Next Topic" so progress is scannable.

## Narrative Planning

1. **Choose a relatable domain** the learner understands without expertise (a simple config system, managing a resource).
2. **Start with the simplest example** — 3-4 lines that demonstrate the core concept.
3. **Build incrementally** — each section adds one layer of complexity or one supporting concept.
4. **Plan the verifiable outputs** — points where printed or observed output lets the learner confirm the code behaved as claimed.
5. **Name the core insight** — the single realization the whole tutorial drives the learner toward.

## Drafting Rules

When writing the tutorial from this structure:

- **Warm, welcoming tone**: "Welcome", "Let's", "notice that", "try changing X".
- **One concept per section**; explain the concept before its code; explain every code block; show intermediate output.
- **Never branch** the learning path.
- You will receive both this structure and the research findings. The structure says WHAT to cover;
  the research findings (especially `groundingDetail`) carry the REAL imports, signatures, and examples —
  copy them exactly, never substitute general knowledge.
- The findings' **history** section carries what the library's own commits and PRs state about this
  concept: why it works this way, what a member used to be called, which usages the compiler rejects,
  where a platform differs. Use each one where it belongs — the opening motivation, a gotcha you warn
  the learner about, a version note — retold in your own words, never quoting a commit or citing a PR
  number. Teach nothing a finding contradicts, and invent nothing when history said nothing.
- Two fields carry planning intent, not text to copy: a **verifiable output** is realized by showing
  that output, not by writing the phrase; the **core insight** is built toward in the prose, not
  announced as a label.
- End with **"What You've Learned"** (objectives restated as achievements) and **"Where to Go Next"**.
- **"Putting It Together"** code block: don't inline code — use an empty block fenced
  `scala mdoc:embed:<library>-examples/<id>/src/main/scala/<pkg>/CompleteExample.scala`
  (`<pkg>` = id without hyphens). The examples phase creates that file.
- Include the **"Running the Examples"** section after "Putting It Together", following the template above exactly.
