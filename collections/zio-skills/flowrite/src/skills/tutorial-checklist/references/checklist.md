# Tutorial Review Checklist

Verify every item. The tutorial is not done until all pass.

## Content Quality

- States who it is for (newcomer, assumed prior knowledge).
- Learning objectives stated upfront as a bullet list.
- Learning objectives restated at the end in "What You've Learned".
- Follows a strict linear path (no branching, no "alternatively").
- Every section introduces exactly one new concept or builds incrementally.
- No section is pure prose without a code example — excepting Introduction, Background,
  "What You've Learned" and "Where to Go Next", which are prose by design.
- Every code example is explained.
- Intermediate results are shown (printed or observed) after each major step.
- The running example is simple and clearly demonstrates the core concepts.
- Types and APIs are introduced only as needed (no front-loaded theory).
- Warm, welcoming tone ("welcome", "let's", "notice that").
- "Putting It Together" is a complete, self-contained, copy-paste-ready example, delivered as an EMPTY
  block fenced `scala mdoc:embed:<path-to-CompleteExample.scala>` — never code inlined in the page. Fail
  this when the section inlines its example: the embedded file is what the examples build compiles and a
  reader runs, so inlining ships code no build has verified as standalone.
- "Running the Examples" embeds each concept's file the same way, inside a collapsible
  `<details><summary>` with `:show-line-numbers`, and every embedded path exists.
- A "Background" section, if present, explains motivation without code.
- The writing style rules are evaluated in the same review pass — report their violations as failing items too.

## Technical Accuracy

- All method signatures and type names match the actual source code. Verify against each core type's
  cited `source` (`path:L<start>-L<end>`) in the research: jump to those lines; if the type isn't there
  (source drifted), `grep` its name in that same file. Never trust the tutorial's prose alone.
- No deprecated methods or outdated patterns.
- `sbt "docs/mdoc --in docs/guides/<id>.md --out website/docs/guides/<id>.md"` reports zero `[error]` lines (mandatory before done).

## Review Cadence

- Fix every failing item in one editing pass.
- The run has a bounded number of review rounds and the review tool's description states how many.
  When a review reports failing items, fix them all and call review ONCE more: that confirming round
  is what records the page as passing, since the verdict is whatever the last review found. A review
  that reported nothing needs no confirmation — finish instead.
- Name every item you could not fix in the final summary, and report the run as failed when any
  remain. An unverified fix is not a pass.
