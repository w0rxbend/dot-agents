# Module Reference Review Checklist

Verify every item. The module reference is not done until all pass. This checklist reviews the
**module page** (the flat page, or the hierarchical index). Per-type member coverage is checked
separately and deterministically (a method-coverage gate runs per type before this checklist) — do
not attempt to re-count members here.

## Module Narrative (the reason a module reference exists)

- Opening definition appears immediately after the frontmatter with NO heading, states the module's
  purpose, and lists the core types as inline code.
- The opening includes a plain ```scala structural block (no bodies) showing the shape of the main types.
- A **"How They Work Together"** section is present — this is the centerpiece. It shows the typical
  workflow / data flow (numbered steps) AND an ASCII diagram of the type relationships. A module
  reference missing this section FAILS.
- Motivation, where present, gives a reason the reader shares — the problem the module solves for them.
  Fail it when the page explains the repo's own work instead: fixtures, test coverage, tooling, the
  docs pipeline, a refactor. Such a reason can be perfectly true and still belong nowhere on the page.
- Common Patterns are documented when the module has named patterns (decision trees / multi-type
  composition), with realistic cross-type examples — not just single-type snippets.
- Integration Points explain how the types relate internally and to other modules, with
  relative-path cross-references.

## Layout & Structure

- The layout matches the shape the design chose: `single-core` and `dsl` are one flat page,
  `core-family` and `multi-domain` are an index plus subpages. Check that consistency only — the shape
  follows reader intent and is the design phase's call, so a type count is never grounds to fail a page.
- Flat: every core and supporting type has an `##` section, in a sensible order; each covers every
  public member grouped concisely (one example per operation group).
- Hierarchical: the index links to every type subpage; the Overview introduces each core type in
  2-3 sentences with a working relative-path link.
- Sections appear in template order (definition → motivation → installation → overview →
  how they work together → common patterns → integration → type-level → running the examples).
- Between any two code blocks there is an explanatory paragraph — no two fenced blocks are adjacent.

## Coverage & Accuracy

- Every core type discovered in research is documented (flat section or hierarchical subpage) — none dropped.
- Relationships and composition shown in the narrative reflect the real source, not invented links.
- The writing style rules are evaluated in the same review pass — report their violations as
  failing items too.
- mdoc reports zero `[error]` lines — mandatory before done. `mdoc` is an sbt task, never a shell
  binary, so run it through sbt with the whole task quoted as one argument:
  `sbt "docs/mdoc --in docs/reference/<module-kebab>.md --out website/docs/reference/<module-kebab>.md"`
  for a flat page, and one `--in`/`--out` pair per page for a hierarchical one (the index and every
  subpage). A bare `mdoc` is not installed anywhere and reports nothing about the page.

## Review Cadence

- Fix every failing item in one editing pass.
- The run has a bounded number of review rounds and the review tool's description states how many.
  When a review reports failing items, fix them all and call review ONCE more: that confirming round
  is what records the page as passing, since the verdict is whatever the last review found. A review
  that reported nothing needs no confirmation — finish instead.
- Name every item you could not fix in the final summary, and report the run as failed when any
  remain. An unverified fix is not a pass.
