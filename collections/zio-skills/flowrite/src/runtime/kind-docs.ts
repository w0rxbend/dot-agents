/**
 * The reference docs a role needs, keyed by document kind.
 *
 * Imported here rather than by each consumer, so the per-kind mapping lives in one place. Roles
 * read them at their own render, which works because `docKind()` is reachable from a subagent render
 * (see run-context.ts: the module holder exists because "the readers are phase-tool bodies AND subagent
 * renders", and the root render runs "before every phase tool and subagent render … correctly ordered
 * by construction").
 *
 * Why a role render and not `useSkill`: mounting costs the delegate three tool round-trips to
 * activate a skill and read its resource, each re-sending its whole accumulated context. That was
 * measured — mounting `writing-style` on the drafter wasted 2 round-trips in write-data-type-ref-turn20
 * and 5 in write-module-ref-turn5, which is why 600f48a unmounted it. A doc returned as part of the
 * render's instruction string costs nothing extra: it is already in the system prompt the delegate
 * starts from.
 *
 * Why a role render and not the caller's prompt: once the writer delegates with the built-in `task`
 * tool rather than through a phase tool, the only party that could paste a template is the MODEL —
 * and a model asked to reproduce 103 lines of structure.md verbatim paraphrases it.
