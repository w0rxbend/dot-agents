/**
 * Stops a phase tool from running inside another phase.
 *
 * Flue gives a `harness: true` tool's scratch conversation the parent agent's ENTIRE tool
 * registry and its system prompt verbatim, and there is no way to scope either
 * (`OperationOptions.tools` is additive; `tools: []` was tested and changes nothing). So a phase tool
 * can call another phase tool, each nesting one delegation level, until the runtime's cap of 4 trips.
 * When that happened in a module-ref run, the review roles became unreachable and five pages shipped
 * with no review while the agent reported success. See withastro/flue#561.
 *
 * Re-entry is not caused by instruction wording — that was tested directly and rewording made it
 * worse. The model re-enters when it cannot make progress: stuck, it falls back to the only thing
 * its inherited instructions describe, the whole pipeline. That is unfixable from the prompt side,
 * hence a guard.
 *
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` rather than a boolean flag, and this is the part that matters: the model
 * legitimately issues several phase calls in ONE turn from the root agent — reviewing an index and a
 * subpage, say. Those are siblings, not nesting, and a flag would refuse all but the first. ALS tells
 * them apart: a nested call inherits the frame, a concurrent root call starts empty. Verified in a
 * clean-room repro, including that ALS propagates across the `harness.prompt()` boundary.

 * Every re-entry this guard blocked. Empty is the expected case.
 *
 * Collected because a refusal is not a runtime event, so the end-of-run report cannot observe it — and
 * counting `Maximum delegation depth` errors is no substitute: nesting only errors if it happens to
 * reach depth 4, and measured runs nested with zero such errors.

 * phase filed the report 40 minutes before its own review finished, and one module-ref run had three
 * reports because three phases each filed one. Same inheritance hazard as re-entry: every phase's
 * harness conversation receives the writer's system prompt verbatim, including SHARED_DIRECTIVE's
 * "when the work is done, call report_run_result", and acts on it.
 *
 * Separate from `guardPhase` because the two differ in both directions. This one opens no phase
 * frame — a report is not a phase and must not make a later sibling call look nested — and its
 * advice tells the caller to return its result rather than to delegate, since delegating a report
 * would just move the same mistake.
