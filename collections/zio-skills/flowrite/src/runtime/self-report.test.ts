// What report_run_result records, now that the verdict is self-reported again.
//
// `review_page` and `fact_check_page` — the harness tools that used to hold a schema-validated
// verdict in TypeScript for `recordedVerdict()` to derive from — are retired: `reviewer` (which later
// absorbed `fact_checker` into one merged identity) is an ordinary subagent reached with `task` now,
// and a `task` delegation returns prose that nothing can validate. So the model reports its own
// verdict again, same as it did before
// d700d2b6/e93719ac fixed the three measured cases where that claim diverged from the evidence
// (tinytally turn1's exact inversion chief among them — see self-report.ts's docstring).
//
// These tests pin the restored contract: the schema requires `reviewVerdict` and `failingItems`, a
// "failed" verdict with no failing items is logged as suspicious (not rejected — there is no
// evidence to check it against any more), and the verdict line keeps its `{passed, failingItems}`
// shape for `scripts/run-report.mjs`.
