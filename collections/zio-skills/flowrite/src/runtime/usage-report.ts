/**
 * Per-run token, cost, and per-component usage reporting.
 *
 * This lived in the deleted workflow wrapper's `finally` block, which was the only
 * caller of the two trackers. Without it a run produces no cost figures at all,
 * which breaks both the "observable by construction" property and any comparison
 * against an archived run.
 *
 * Tracking starts at module load rather than in a hook: `observe()` is
 * process-global, one process serves one run, and the trackers must be subscribed
 * before the first turn — earlier than any render. Reporting hangs off
 * `useAgentFinish`, whose callbacks run at least once, so a guard keeps the summary
 * to a single emission.
 *
 * Logs go to stderr: `flue run` reserves stdout for the reply, and `--json` expects
 * it to parse.
