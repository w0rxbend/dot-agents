 * Generic documentation planner, shared across document kinds. Declares

 *
 * The kind's structure template is read here, at this render, via `docKind()` — see drafter.ts for
 * why that beats both a skill mount and a caller-pasted prompt. The result SCHEMA still comes from
 * the delegating call site, because that genuinely does vary per call and cannot be derived from the
 * kind alone: a module design takes a layout override, a data-type design does not.
