# tinyproject Documentation Website

This directory contains the Docusaurus documentation site for tinyproject.

## Quick Start

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
# or npm install
```

### Start the development server

```bash
yarn start
# or npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build for production

```bash
yarn build
# or npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
