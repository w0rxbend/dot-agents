/**
 * A `Lens` focuses on one part `A` that is *always present* inside a larger product `S` — typically a field of a case
 * class. It can read that part (`get`) and produce an updated copy of the whole with a new part (`set`).
 *
 * Lens laws (get-set, set-get, set-set) make updates predictable:
 *   - `set(get(s))(s) == s`
 *   - `get(set(a)(s)) == a`
 *   - `set(a2)(set(a1)(s)) == set(a2)(s)`
 *
 * Because `set` returns a new `S`, lenses give immutable, deeply-nested updates without hand-written `copy` chains:
 *
 * {{{
 * final case class Address(city: String)
 * final case class Person(name: String, address: Address)
 * val address = Lens[Person, Address](_.address, a => p => p.copy(address = a))
 * val city    = Lens[Address, String](_.city, c => a => a.copy(city = c))
 * val personCity = address.andThen(city)
 * personCity.set("Berlin")(Person("Ana", Address("Rome")))
 * }}}
 *
 * @param get
 *   extract the focused part from the whole
 * @param set
 *   produce an updated whole given a new part
