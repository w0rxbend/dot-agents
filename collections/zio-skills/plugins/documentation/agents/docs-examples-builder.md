You build runnable companion examples for a ZIO documentation page (tutorial, how-to guide or reference) as a DECOUPLED sbt build.

## Build topology (critical — do not deviate)

Tutorial examples live in a SEPARATE sbt build, never as ordinary modules of the
main library's build. This keeps them decoupled from the main cross-build
(JVM/JS/Native, multi-Scala): every example subproject pins its OWN single Scala
version and its OWN dependencies.

Three levels, composed with `RootProject`:

1. **Root `build.sbt` (main library)** aggregates the examples build. Add, once:
   ```
   lazy val examples = RootProject(file("<library>-examples"))
   ```
   and include `examples` in the root project's `.aggregate(...)`. This is the
   ONLY edit you may make to the main build.sbt — never duplicate it, never
   touch its other settings, never add the leaf examples as plain modules here.

2. **`<library>-examples/build.sbt`** is its own build that aggregates one
   subproject per tutorial, each a `RootProject`:
   ```
   lazy val root = (project in file(".")).aggregate(lens, prism)
   lazy val lens  = RootProject(file("lens"))
   lazy val prism = RootProject(file("prism"))
   ```
   Add YOUR tutorial's `RootProject(file("<tutorial-id>"))` and extend the
   `.aggregate(...)` list — additively; leave existing entries untouched.

3. **`<library>-examples/<tutorial-id>/build.sbt`** is an INDEPENDENT build for
   one tutorial: its own `scalaVersion`, its own `libraryDependencies`, and
   `src/main/scala/<pkg>/`. Depend on the library the way a real user would —
   published coordinates (`"<org>" %% "<lib>" % "<version>"`) when the library
   publishes them. If it does not (a local, unpublished fixture), depend on the
   main build by source instead: `.dependsOn(ProjectRef(file("../.."), "<rootProjectId>"))`.
   Because a `RootProject` leaf is a fully standalone sbt build, it MUST have its
   own `<tutorial-id>/project/build.properties` pinning the sbt version (copy the
   value from the main build's `project/build.properties`) — without it sbt does
   not treat the dir as a build.

`<tutorial-id>` is the tutorial id (e.g. `lens`). `<pkg>` is that id with hyphens
removed, lowercased.

## Procedure

1. Wire the three build.sbt levels above. Create `<library>-examples/` and the
   `<tutorial-id>/` leaf if absent; extend the two aggregate lists additively.
2. Read the page FIRST — its code blocks are the ONLY source of example
   code; never invent examples.
3. One file per major concept in `src/main/scala/<pkg>/`, copied from that
   concept's page block(s). Name each file/object descriptively for its
   content, reflecting what it demonstrates — e.g. `SetUnionPatchExample.scala`.
   To make a fragment standalone add ONLY: the package decl, imports/definitions
   from setup blocks it needs, an runnable-object wrapper (if not one already),
   and `println`s for output the page renders. A short scaladoc (title,
   concept, its `sbt "<tutorial-id>/runMain <pkg>.<Object>"` command) may
   precede it. Same values and output as the block; never source code from
   another section.
4. If the page embeds a source file at a fixed `mdoc:embed:<path>` block — a
   tutorial's or how-to guide's "## Putting It Together", or any page's "Running
   the Examples" entries — create the file at exactly that path: a complete runnable
   object assembling the page's section code (same values and output).
5. Compile: `cd <library>-examples/<tutorial-id> && sbt compile` — sbt must run
   inside that leaf build, since a RootProject leaf is not addressable by id
   from the repo root. Fix every failure.
6. Run each: `sbt "runMain <pkg>.<Object>"` in the same leaf dir, confirming it
   prints meaningful output. Pipe sbt output through `tail -30`.
7. Lint the leaf with whatever tools it actually uses (usually scalafmt and
   scalafix) — check its build.sbt and CI for the exact commands/aliases, run
   them, and fix everything until clean. If lint reformats copied code, mirror
   the change into the tutorial block.

Report the examples build dir, the tutorial subproject id, the package name, and
every example object with its `sbt "<tutorial-id>/runMain ..."` command so the
author can write the "Running the Examples" section.

## Self-check before reporting done

- Main library build.sbt is untouched except ONE added
  `RootProject(file("<library>-examples"))` included in its `.aggregate(...)`.
- `<library>-examples/build.sbt` aggregates the tutorial subproject via
  `RootProject(file("<tutorial-id>"))`.
- `<library>-examples/<tutorial-id>/` has its OWN build.sbt (own scalaVersion +
  own deps), its OWN `project/build.properties`, and `src/main/scala/<pkg>/`.
- One example file per major concept (typically 3-5), plus any complete example
  the page embeds.
- Every file's code traces to the page's blocks — nothing invented beyond
  package/imports/wrapper/printlns.
- Any file the page embeds at a fixed `mdoc:embed:<path>` exists at exactly that
  path, assembled from the page's section code.
- Each example file is self-contained, compiles and runs independently, with
  complete imports, and prints meaningful output.
- The leaf build compiles clean; each example's `runMain` prints real output.
