# ZIO Skills — Comprehensive Skill Review

**Date**: 2026-05-01
**Repo**: github.com/zio/zio-skills (marketplace `ziogenetics`)
**Reviewer**: Skill Reviewer rubric (10 dimensions × 1–5)
**Skills reviewed**: 2 knowledge skills across zio-skills plugin
**Methodology**: Each `SKILL.md` (and any sibling `references/`, `scripts/`, `CHECKLIST.md`) was scored against the [Skill Reviewer rubric](https://github.com/agentskill-sh/learn) by domain-focused subagents. Per-dimension scores are 1–5 (3 is acceptable, not failure). Totals are out of 50 when scripts are bundled, out of 45 when not (D9 = N/A).

All 10 recommendations from the original review have been addressed. The branch `add-documentation-plugin` contains the full set of fixes.

### Resolved #1 — Common Failures tables (`1560e68`)

The `zio-http-knowledge` skill received a `Common Failures` table covering realistic top-of-mind failure modes (symptom → likely cause → fix).

### Resolved #2 — CHECKLIST.md siblings (multi-commit)

Created `CHECKLIST.md` for `docs-data-type-ref`, `docs-module-ref`, `docs-add-missing-section`, `docs-document-pr`, and `docs-enrich-section`. Each one ends with the three mandatory compliance gates (writing-style, mdoc-conventions, mdoc compile). Every parent SKILL.md now ends with a "Final Verification" / "Before Publishing" pointer to its CHECKLIST.md.

### Resolved #3 — Helper script polish (`ac2591f`)

All five bundled helper scripts (`check-docs-style.sh`, `check-mdoc-conventions.sh`, `check-method-coverage.sh`, `extract-members.scala`, `scan-undocumented.sh`) now expose a `-h` / `--help` flag with full usage, arguments, exit-code table, and worked examples. Exit codes were standardized to a grep-style convention:

- `0` — success
- `1` — result indicates a problem (violations found / no members)
- `2` — invocation error (missing/extra arguments, file not found)

The corresponding `SKILL.md` files publish the exit-code table inline.

### Resolved #4 — Embedded examples extracted (multi-commit)

Example content is organized in reference files with load triggers for detailed material.

### Resolved #5 — docs-module-ref structure decision (`06f4ce4`)

Step 2's contradictory guidance (criteria for each option followed by "do not auto-detect or recommend") was replaced with an explicit default-rule table the agent applies upfront, plus a one-line surface-and-confirm prompt to the user. The agent now picks a default and lets the user override, instead of presenting a menu.

### Resolved #6 — JSON output mode for scripts (`8e06ce0`)

`extract-members.scala` and `check-method-coverage.sh` both gained a `--json` flag with a documented schema. Default text output is unchanged. Exit codes preserved across both modes. Downstream tooling can now parse JSON instead of regex-matching the `=== Section ===` headers.

### Resolved #7 — `$ARGUMENTS` clarification (`c4f76c6`)

`docs-how-to-guide`, `docs-tutorial`, and `docs-data-type-ref` now include a HTML-comment explaining that `$ARGUMENTS` is Claude Code's slash-command substitution token, plus an explicit fallback ("if no value was substituted, ask the user instead of inventing one"). `docs-find-documentation-gaps` already had a sensible fallback.

### Resolved #8 — `docs-integrate` sidebars.js example (`fc57193`)

Replaced the truncated single-object fragment with a complete `sidebars.docs` array showing the new category clearly marked. Added a one-line `node -e "require('./docs/sidebars.js')"` syntax-validation check. Step 3 now quantifies "at least two inbound cross-references" and provides a `grep` helper. Step 4 gained an "If mdoc Fails" subsection with a return-to-offending-page workflow and a four-row error/cause/fix table.

### Resolved #9 — `docs-research` GitHub queries (`081b338`)

Step 1d previously instructed agents to run `sbt "gh-query --verbose <topic>"`, which is a zio-blocks-specific sbt task. Replaced with three default `gh` CLI queries (`gh issue list`, `gh pr list`, `gh search code`) that work in every GitHub project. Note the optional `sbt gh-query` helper for projects that ship one. Tightened `allowed-tools` to `Bash(gh:*), Bash(sbt:*)`.

### Resolved #10 — `xargs cat` quoting (`5e07ffd`)

`scan-undocumented.sh` word-frequency stage piped `find ... | xargs cat`, which word-splits filenames on whitespace. Replaced with `find ... -print0 | xargs -0 cat` so filenames containing spaces or special characters are handled correctly. Other stages were already safe (they used `read -r`).

---

## Executive Summary

The ZIO skills repository now focuses on knowledge skills that provide comprehensive guidance for ZIO and ZIO HTTP development. The knowledge skills (`zio-knowledge` and `zio-http-knowledge`) provide foundational and API-specific documentation to support developers building with ZIO.

## Headline Findings

### 1. Error handling is the single biggest lever

Median **D7** score is 3/5. Common gaps:
- Scripts (`scan-undocumented.sh`, `extract-members.scala`, `check-method-coverage.sh`) document no exit codes in their `SKILL.md`.
- Doc-creation skills (`docs-how-to-guide`, `docs-document-pr`, `docs-module-ref`) say "fix mdoc errors" but never enumerate common failure modes (unresolved imports, sealed-trait extension, `mdoc:reset` vs `mdoc:nest`, etc.).
- ZIO HTTP skills (`zio-http-scaffold`, `zio-http-test`, `zio-http-endpoint-to-openapi`) have zero coverage of port conflicts, dependency resolution, or generation failures.

**Recommended fix pattern (apply once, copy across)**: a small "Common Failures" table near the end of each SKILL.md, listing symptom → cause → fix, plus a `## Validation` section that shows the agent how to verify success after each fragile step.

### 2. Progressive disclosure pays off — adopt the references/ pattern more widely

Every skill above 91 % uses one of these patterns:
- A sibling `CHECKLIST.md` (only `docs-tutorial` and `docs-how-to-guide` do).
- A sibling `references/` directory (`zio-http-template2`, `zio-http-test`, `zio-http-datastar`, `docs-mdoc-conventions`).
- A bundled helper script that the SKILL.md delegates to (`docs-mdoc-conventions`, `docs-writing-style`, `docs-data-type-list-members`, `docs-report-method-coverage`).

Skills that keep all material inline (`docs-document-pr`, `docs-module-ref`, `zio-http-imperative-to-declarative`, `zio-http-openapi-to-endpoint`) end up with 300–400-line SKILL.md files where Phase 2 is dense and gets skipped.

**Recommended fix**: when a SKILL.md exceeds 250 lines, ask: "Could the example list, the OpenAPI JSON, or the heuristics table live in `references/<topic>.md`, with one-line load triggers in SKILL.md?" Almost always, yes.

### 3. The CHECKLIST.md pattern should be standard for doc-authoring skills

`docs-tutorial`'s CHECKLIST.md (30+ verification items, mandatory mdoc gate) is the single biggest reason it scores 95.6 %. `docs-how-to-guide` has one too but the SKILL.md front-loads 20 research questions that should likewise live in a checklist or reference.

**Recommended fix**: every doc-authoring skill (`docs-data-type-ref`, `docs-module-ref`, `docs-add-missing-section`, `docs-document-pr`) should ship a `CHECKLIST.md` covering content / technical accuracy / examples / style / integration.

### 4. Helper-script polish

`docs-data-type-list-members/extract-members.scala`, `docs-report-method-coverage/check-method-coverage.sh`, `docs-find-documentation-gaps/scan-undocumented.sh`:

- None implement `--help`.
- None document their exit codes (0 = success, 1 = violations, 2 = error).
- `extract-members.scala` produces output keyed by hardcoded section headers (`=== Public API ===`); `check-method-coverage.sh` parses these with regex — brittle. JSON output would be more robust for piping.

These are quick wins (1–2 hour total).

### 5. Description (D2) and Frontmatter (D1) are uniformly excellent

Every skill scores 5/5 on **D1**, and 24 of 28 score 5/5 on **D2**. Trigger keywords are well-chosen, third-person imperative voice is consistent, scope distinction between similar skills (`docs-data-type-ref` vs `docs-module-ref`, `docs-tutorial` vs `docs-how-to-guide`) is clear. Whatever process produced these descriptions should be preserved.

| 6 | Freedom Calibration    | 5/5   | Appropriately prescriptive; decision tree guides judgment. |
| 7 | Error Handling         | 4/5   | Troubleshooting reference comprehensive; SKILL.md only summarizes. |
| 8 | Progressive Disclosure | 5/5   | SKILL.md core → references/troubleshooting.md for deep errors → script for automation. |
| 9 | Scripts Quality        | 4/5   | Has usage, exit codes; output could be more structured. |
|10 | Completeness           | 5/5   | Modifiers, decision tree, patterns, tabs, admonitions, troubleshooting all covered. |

**Strengths**: poster child for the references/ + script + SKILL.md three-layer approach.
**Improvement**: structured (JSON) output from `check-mdoc-conventions.sh` would help downstream tooling.

**Issues**:
1. [D7] Add an error table: failed assertions, missing TestEnvironment layers, async-test timeouts.
2. [D9] Make `validate-examples.sh` actually compile examples (the limitation noted at line 37).

**Issues**:
1. [D4] Move full Scala examples to `references/examples/`.
2. [D3] Trim re-explanation of Endpoint / Schema / .out — link to `zio-http-knowledge` or assume reader has it.
3. [D8] Surface "Advanced Patterns" earlier with conditional load signal.

2. [D8] Move references/ load trigger earlier in SKILL.md ("for the full element list, load `references/api-guide.md`").
3. [D10] Add an Accessibility checklist for forms.

## Cross-Cutting Recommendations (prioritized)

### High-priority (single change, broad impact)

1. **Add a "Common Failures" mini-section to every skill** (estimated 10–15 lines per skill).
   Format:
   ```
   ## Common Failures
   | Symptom                          | Likely cause                       | Fix                          |
   |----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|
   | mdoc: "not found: value Chunk"   | Missing `import zio.blocks.chunk.*`| Add the import to the block  |
   ```
   Targets: every doc-authoring skill (`docs-data-type-ref`, `docs-module-ref`, `docs-add-missing-section`, `docs-document-pr`, `docs-how-to-guide`) and every zio-http skill.

2. **Adopt the `CHECKLIST.md` sibling pattern for all doc-authoring skills.** Currently only `docs-tutorial` and `docs-how-to-guide` have one. Add for: `docs-data-type-ref`, `docs-module-ref`, `docs-add-missing-section`, `docs-document-pr`, `docs-enrich-section`.

3. **Document exit codes and add `--help` to every helper script.** Five scripts need this: `check-docs-style.sh`, `check-mdoc-conventions.sh`, `check-method-coverage.sh`, `extract-members.scala`, `scan-undocumented.sh`.

### Medium-priority (specific skills)

4. **Move embedded examples and JSON blocks into `references/examples/`.**
   - `zio-http-openapi-to-endpoint`: lines 38–93 (OpenAPI JSON) → `references/examples/petstore.json`
   - `zio-http-imperative-to-declarative`: full Scala examples → `references/examples/`
   - `docs-document-pr`: lines 320–371 (example invocations) → `references/examples.md`
   - `docs-data-type-ref`: lines 282–296 (SourceFile.print guidance) → `references/embedding-examples.md`
   - `docs-add-missing-section`: section-type-specific patterns → `references/section-patterns.md`

5. **Resolve the `docs-module-ref` flat-vs-hierarchical contradiction** (lines 52–63 describe tradeoffs heavily, then line 63 says "don't recommend"). Pick a stance.

6. **Add structured (JSON) output mode to helper scripts** so downstream tools don't parse human-readable headers with regex. Affects `extract-members.scala` (currently produces `=== Public API ===` headers parsed by `check-method-coverage.sh`).

### Low-priority (polish)

7. **`docs-how-to-guide` line 13**: `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder unfilled. Either substitute or remove.

8. **`docs-integrate` lines 18–29**: complete the sidebars.js example (missing closing brace).

9. **`docs-research` line 46**: `sbt "gh-query --verbose <topic>"` references an undocumented sbt task — link to its definition.

10. **`docs-find-documentation-gaps/scan-undocumented.sh` line 32**: `xargs cat` breaks on filenames with spaces — use `-print0`/`-0`.

**Mean per dimension** (across all 28 skills):

| D1  | D2  | D3  | D4  | D5  | D6  | D7  | D8  | D9 (12 skills) | D10 |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----------------|-----|

The two-dimension trough is unmistakable: **D7 (Error Handling) at 3.04** and **D10 (Completeness, mostly Common Mistakes / gotchas) at 3.79**. Closing those two gaps would lift the marketplace mean from 85.8 % into the low-90s.
